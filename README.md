# Hey, I'm Etan

Full stack developer in Israel. I build products and occasionally let AI build them for me.

## What I'm Building

### The Golems Ecosystem

I spend a lot of time thinking about how to make AI actually useful for shipping code. This led to building a suite of tools:

**[Ralph](https://github.com/EtanHey/claude-golem)** — An autonomous engineering loop for Claude Code. Give it a PRD, it executes stories, self-corrects, and notifies you when done. Smart model routing (Opus for planning, Sonnet for implementation, Haiku for verification), cost tracking, worktree isolation. It's how I ship most of my code now.

**[Zikaron](https://github.com/EtanHey/zikaron)** — Memory layer that indexes Claude Code conversations into a searchable knowledge base. Extracts patterns from your past sessions so you don't solve the same problems twice.

**Autonomous Bots** — Telegram integration for Ralph notifications + an experimental Ollama-based "digital presence" that can work autonomously during off-hours.

### Active Projects

| Project | Stack | What it does |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| **[Cantaloupe AI](https://trycantaloupe.com)** | Next.js, React Native, Supabase | Automated hiring platform — AI conducts voice interviews 24/7 |
| **Private** | Next.js, Expo, Supabase | Property platform (stealth) |
| **[SongScript](https://github.com/EtanHey/songscript)** | TanStack Start, Convex, React 19 | Learn languages through music with line-by-line transliteration |

## Open Source

- **[SongScript](https://github.com/EtanHey/songscript)** — Language learning through music. Synchronized lyrics, word breakdowns, progress tracking.
- **[Claude Golem (Ralph)](https://github.com/EtanHey/claude-golem)** — The autonomous AI coding loop. Spec-driven, self-correcting, cost-aware.
- **[Hand Sign Detection](https://github.com/EtanHey/hand-sign-detection)** — YOLO-based gesture recognition
- **[Bank Activity Parser](https://github.com/EtanHey/bank-activity-parser)** — Parse and view bank statements
- **[etanheyman.com](https://github.com/EtanHey/etanheyman.com)** — My portfolio (Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind v4)
